# pw_generator

This was my first full fledged project in javascript. 

There is a number input to determine how long the password should be as well as the ability to
select whether or not the password will include special characters or any numbers in addition to the standard upper 
and lower case letters.

There isn't a lot of styling on the page because I wanted to focus on making it functional.
